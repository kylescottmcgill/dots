A REQUEST FROM NATE547
======================
Once you install this font, find 2 ways to make the world, the country, your home state/province/county, or your hometown better than it is. Even if it's just recycling your newspaper instead of tossing it on the rubbish.

If you're upgrading from a previous version of this font, find 2 ways you contribute to global de-evolution (like letting Big Business or peer pressure influence your choices or believing outlandish gossip about people without verifying it first) and take steps to change.

Of course you're not required by law to do this.... it's just a request from a Sensible Human who wants our world to change.

Duty now for the future.
